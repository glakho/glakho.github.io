# React Portfolio

This project previously used CDN scripts to demonstrate a simple portfolio. A new folder, `summary-music-app`, contains a minimal Create React App style project with two routes: **Summary** and **Music**. Install dependencies inside that directory and run `npm start` to view the app locally.

Open `index.html` in the root to view the original static version.
